## Introduction
Welcome to our website for the Pizza Planet! Our website is designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience when ordering their favorite pizza.

### Technologies Used
To build this site, I used the following technologies:

- React: a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It was chosen for its ability to efficiently render components and manage application state, making it ideal for building complex, interactive web applications.

- JavaScript: a widely-used programming language that allows developers to add interactivity to their websites. It was used to add functionality to the Pizza Restaurant website, such as validating user input and dynamically updating the UI in response to user actions.

- Bootstrap: a popular open-source CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built components for creating responsive and mobile-first websites. It was chosen for its ease of use and ability to quickly create a modern and polished user interface.

- Redux: a popular state management library for JavaScript applications. It was used to manage application state in a predictable and centralized way, making it easier to reason about and debug the code.

- Styled-components: a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows developers to write CSS styles directly in their JavaScript code. It was used to create reusable and composable UI components with scoped styles, making it easier to maintain and refactor the codebase.

- Scrollreveal: a JavaScript library that provides easy-to-use animations for scrolling elements into view. It was used to add subtle animations to the Pizza Restaurant website, making the user experience more engaging and visually appealing.

Overall, these technologies were chosen for their ability to work together seamlessly and provide a powerful and flexible foundation for building a modern and responsive web application.
